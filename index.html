     <h3>His Career</h3>
     
     <p >At the start of his career, he used his father’s stage name, Carlton, but, encouraged by a colleague, he began to appear under the 
     family’s original, unusual surname in order to attract greater professional attention. Cumberbatch’s first work in the professional 
     theatre was primarily Shakespearean, beginning with two repertory seasons with the New Shakespeare Company in London’s Regent Park 
     in 2001 and 2002. Over the next few years, he continued performing in London theatres, often in classics such as Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda 
     Gabler (2005; nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for best supporting actor) and Eugène Ionesco’s Rhinoceros (2007). He became a 
     familiar face on television as well, playing supporting roles in series such as Tipping the Velvet and Silent Witness (both 2002), 
     Fortysomething (2003), and To the Ends of the Earth (2005). In 2005 he was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for best actor for his 
     portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in the BBC television biopic Hawking (2004). Cumberbatch’s first major film role was in Amazing
     Grace (2006), a historical treatment of politician William Wilberforce’s antislavery efforts, in which Cumberbatch played Prime 
     Minister William Pitt the Younger.</p>

     <p>In 2010 he broke through to far greater popularity at home and abroad as Sherlock Holmes in the BBC television series Sherlock, based
     on the stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The adaptation placed the characters of the classic Victorian-era tales in 21st-century 
     London, and viewers’ imaginations were captured by its contemporary Holmes, who used nicotine patches (a nod to Conan Doyle’s
     pipe-smoking Holmes) and was a self-described “high-functioning sociopath.” Cumberbatch remained in the public eye with subsequent
     seasons of Sherlock. In 2014 his performance in a episode of the series’ third season won him an Emmy Award for outstanding actor 
     in a miniseries or movie.</p>

     Jonny Lee Miller in the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creature. He earned rave reviews for his work and won several major 
     theatrical awards, including the 2012 Olivier Award in Britain. He rounded out 2011 with roles in two high-profile films, Steven 
     Spielberg’s War Horse and a big-screen adaptation of author John le Carré’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Cumberbatch achieved a 
     new level of fame as the villain Khan in the Hollywood blockbuster Star Trek into Darkness (2013).</p>

     <p>Cumberbatch played Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate (2013) and a well-intentioned slave owner in 12 Years a Slave 
     (2013), an adaptation of Solomon Northup’s narrative (1853) of his life in captivity. He then lent his posh growl to the 
     computer-animated dragon Smaug in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013), the second installment in director Peter Jackson’s 
     film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel. He played against type as a hapless young man in August: Osage County (2013), adapted 
     from the play by Tracy Letts.</p>



     <p>In 2014 Cumberbatch starred as mathematician and logician Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, voiced an animated wolf in the comedy 
     Penguins of Madagascar, and reprised his role as Smaug in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. His turn as Turing earned him
     an Academy Award nomination for best actor. Cumberbatch returned to the stage as the titular Danish prince in a 2015 production of 
     Hamlet. The entire run of the show, produced at the Barbican Centre, sold out a year in advance of the show’s opening. Also in 2015
     he appeared in the film Black Mass as a state senator (and brother of gangster Whitey Bulger). The following year he starred in 
     Doctor Strange, portraying a Marvel Comics superhero.</p>
     
     <h3>Personal Life</h3>

     <p>Cumberbatch dated Olivia Poulet on and off for many years before calling it quits for good in 2011. The pair had met at the 
     University of Manchester.</p>

     <p>In November 2014, Cumberbatch became engaged to director Sophie Hunter. The under-the-radar and understated announcement ran in 
     England’s Times newspaper. The couple tied the knot on February 14, 2015, on the Isle of Wight and welcomed their first child, 
     son Christopher Carlton, that June.</p>
